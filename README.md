# Getting Started

### Reference Documentation

Run `./mvnw spring-boot:run` to start the application

Once the application has been started, you can run `npm run-script watch` to see web changes automatically update when refreshing.

Note: I don't think css changes are reloaded with this command, so it may be worth applying your css changes directly to
the js components to finalise styling before refactoring into css.
